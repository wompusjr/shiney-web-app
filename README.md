# shiney-web-app
hey lydia and tony!
Just a quick reference guide for the package.
My scratchpad includes the way I transformed my data so if you have any questions or want to edit that you're able to do that while saving it as Cleaned Grocery
I admit I started this project without reading the final sections of the Shiny module on the course website so I didn't know the example you used was for LMs.
I hope my focus on GLMs and the dredge() function - along with the effort I put into displaying and communicating change - make up for what I'm sure is very derivative.
I didn't publish the app so you'll have to run it through the app.R function, the publishing looked scary and complicated and the module didn't talk about it as far as I could see
everything should be called from within the directory but if not let me know. 
Thanks for the semester and I hope grading this doesn't take too long!
